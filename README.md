# Calories Burnt Prediction

## Project Description
This project aims to predict the number of calories burnt during physical activities using various machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, height, weight, duration of activity, and heart rate, which are used to make the predictions.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calories-burnt-prediction.git
cd calories-burnt-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook to run the code and train the model:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Calories_Burnt_Prediction.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
